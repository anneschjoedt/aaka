                <p>My thesis buddy and I designed, developed and tested a personalised math learning app targeted
                    primary school students in close collaboration with Halstead Preparatory School for Girls and
                    Rygaards International School.</p>

                    <h3 class="heading">Challenge</h3>
                    <p>In collaboration with Halstead Preparatory School for Girls and associate professor in computer
                        science Mircea Lungu we discovered the need for a math learning app that would adapt to each
                        student's math level while
                        they were using it. The app should motivate less confident students in their practice by
                        incoporating
                        gamification elements such as mascots, reward and badge collections. </p>
                </div>
                <div class="description-block">
                    <h3 class="heading">Process</h3>
                    <p> To accomplish our goal, we developed a design based on feedback from actual users. The design
                        process included everything from UI and UX design, datamodelling, prototype and final
                        product development.
                        Our
                        data-driven process included qualitative user interviews and usability tests. We developed the
                        prototype in Figma and the app in React with a backend in Back4app.</p>

                <div class="description-block">
                    <h3 class="heading">Result</h3>
                    <p>The app, Maths Camp, improved the users experience in practicing math problems by optimising
                        their
                        learning
                        experience and keeping them motivated along the way.
                        We worked in a data-driven way and collected data from actual users through interviews, surveys
                        and tools such as Hotjar
                        and turned the insights into requirement specifications. Our thesis recieved the highest grade
                        possible and a new team of developers are currently continuing working on the app.
