                <p>After having won the design competition held by Makwerk, my design was sold as print on posters and
                    t-shirts on dimsstudio.com and in the shop in Århus.</p>

                    <p>Dimsstudio and Makwerk held a design competition in which designers could contribute with a
                        design. The 10 best designs were picked by Makwerk and customers could then vote for the best 3
                        designs, which would be printed on t-shirts and sold.

                    <h3 class="heading-less">Process</h3>
                    <p>I started out by drawing my Frida Kahlo illustration by hand with ink on paper. The illustration
                        were then scanned and edited in Photoshop.
                    </p>

                <div class="description-block">
                    <h3 class="heading-less">Result</h3>
                    <p>The design won the
                        competition together with two other designs and were printed on t-shirts. The design ended up
                        being highly in demand and were later printed on posters as well.
