                <p>In collaboration with three students at IT University of Copenhagen I developed a Google Chrome
                    extension designed to
                    assist users in memorising concepts in programming languages such as Python, Java and JavaScript.

                    <h3 class="heading">Challenge</h3>
                    <p>In the search for new approaches to learn a new programming language, this
                        project scope was defined as developing a Chrome extension to help users memorise concepts,
                        symbols, and terms about programming in Python, Java, and JavaScript, by answering
                        micro-learning exercises.

                    <h3 class="heading">Process</h3>
                    <p> The goal was to give our users an effective learning experience in which the user is interrupted
                        during procrastination (i.e. watching series on Netflix) and prompted to answer 5 coding
                        questions. Upon completion, the user can return to procrastination or choose to further continue
                        practicing programming languages.</p>

                <div class="description-block">
                    <h3 class="heading">Result</h3>
                    <p>The Google Chrome extension was named Practice.now and was designed in Figma and developed in
                        React. We worked in a data-driven way and data was collected
                        from users through persona research, interviews and several usability tests. The
                        insights were turned into functional requirements and implemented into the final design.
