                <p>In collaboration with AnnóAnno - a personal styling universe for curvy women - I designed a new
                    company <a href="https://annoanno.dk/" target="_blank">website</a> and a personal webshop
                    experience.

                    <h3 class="heading">Challenge</h3>
                    <p>AnnóAnno's mission is to offer a universe of personal inspiration and individual guidance, where
                        curvy woman can buy unique and personally curated clothes to embrace and express themselves
                        truly. They needed an updated website which clearly conveyed
                        their mission and value propositions.
                        A few month later I helped design a personal webshop experience and an updated mypage (user
                        profile). The webshop
                        experience should complement their styling concept and intuitivly feel personal to each
                        customer.

                    <h3 class="heading">Process</h3>
                    <p>In close collaboration with the team at AnnóAnno I designed both website and webshop in Figma.
                        The webshop was designed
                        based on a component library called PrimeBlocks as the design was developed in Vue. The design
                        was handed over to a graphic designer which added the finishing touch.</p>

                    <h3 class="heading">Result</h3>
                    <p>The website was developed in Webflow by AnnóAnno's own developing team and is now live, while the
                        webshop is scheduled to launch in April.
